## 🎯 Research Objective
The goal of this case study is to analyze factors that influence the birth weight of newborn babies. Low birth weight (defined as less than 2,500 grams) is associated with increased health risks and developmental issues.

In particular, we examine how maternal characteristics and behavioral factors during pregnancy affect birth weight. The main variables of interest include:

- Age of the mother  
- Years of education  
- Alcohol consumption during pregnancy  
- Smoking during pregnancy  
- Prenatal medical visits  

We study both theoretical expectations and empirical evidence regarding the relationship between these factors and birth outcomes.
